In this project, the goal is to test some UI of this url="https://desktop.any.do" using Selenium (Python) and applying Page Object Model

## Test Cases:
1. Creating a daily task named "My Daily Task"
2. Creating a another task named "My Friday Task"
3. Adding a subtask on "My Friday Task"
4. Creating a list named "My SHopping List"
5. Adding items onto the list
6. Changing theme from Light to Dark
7. Popping Notification Window and check for updates
8. Enabling Multiple Selection Option on list Items
9. Creating Tags and dismissing it
10. Signing out


## Pre-requisite
Log-in using Google Api

## Driver
CromeDriver

## Folder Guide
1. Login implemented on "pages/loginpage.py"
2. All the test case implimentations on "pages/testCases.py" file
3. Initialized Automation "FirstAutomation/login.py" (Run this file on any IDE and this will initialize chrome browser and do all the test tasks automatically)


## Test Case Automation Results
1. I couldn't able to automate Test case 3 (Adding a subtask) and 9 (Creating Tags)
2. And in Test case 5 (Adding Items onto the list), I was unable to add multiple items.
And the rest test cases are automated properly.
